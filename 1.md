## Setup Instructions:

1) Clone this [repo](https://github.com/apache/httpd.git)
2) Install git restore-mtime [(installation)](https://github.com/MestreLion/git-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
3) Run `git restore-mtime` to restore the original modification times of files in the cloned repository.


## Bash script to implement the following

1) Chronologically list files by their modified time (from old to new)  
```
  Mar 2024:  
    some 10 files modified in that time period  
  July 2024:  
    ....  
  Jun 2025:  
    ....
```

2) Count file types. Print the counts of most common types  
```
  .txt   - 43  
  .yaml  - 25  
  .py    - 17
```

3) Find top 5 most active months based on when most files are modified in that time period. (with count of files in that month)

4) Find top 5 largest files in that directory with their sizes

5) Small summary about file permissions like most open files (can be rwx by any one) and restricted files with (rwx by owner only)

6) Create cronjob to generate daily report for the above and clean reports older than a week
